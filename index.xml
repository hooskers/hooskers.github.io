      <description>PDX Live Transit PDX Live Transit consists of a backend piece and a frontend piece that use Trimet&amp;rsquo;s Realtime GTFS API to show all of their vehicles in the Portland metro area on a map in realtime.
The backend is a simple Express server that has Javascript code compiled from Realtime GTFS protobufs. All it does is get the vehicle positions from Trimet&amp;rsquo;s endpoint, marshals it to JSON, and sends it to the client.</description>
